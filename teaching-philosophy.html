<h1 align="center">Teaching Individuals</h1>
<p>
    Education is often modeled as a one size fits all tool to transfer prepackeged knowledge from a book to a brain. I find this model to be totally flawed.
    Learning is an active process taken on by a student and aided by a teacher. A teacher has the task of getting the student excited to learn, presenting the
    knowledge in a way that is accessable to the student, and clarifying misunderstandings. This is the process of a guide and a hero embarking to expand the
    world through the pursuit of truth. Since the primary actor in learning is the individual student, the teacher must consider each individual student and what will
    allow each student to succeed. The best education cannot be achieved without individual attention being paid to each student.

<h1 align="center">Math is Important</h1>
<p>
    Let's face it. Math is largly regarded as the most annoying and oftentimes most difficult subject. This is not the fault of students. This is not because some students
    "just aren't math people." That fatal phrase has discouraged too many students into giving up on math before they even get started. But it doesn't need to be this way.
    Math can be extremely exciting and transformative. With a little bit of math, students can learn how to achieve their financial goals later in life, students can learn
    how to solve the most complex problems our world faces, and students can learn how to think clearly and logically when faced with a difficult situation. The biggest problem
    with modern math education is that it is filled with rules that have no explanation. Students must memorize formulas, specific problem solving methods, and illogical sequences
    of steps in order to solve countless problems without ever learning the most important question: Why? <br><br>Why do we want to solve this problem? How can we solve it? Why does
    this method of problem solving work? What does the explanation of how this problem is solved tell us about problem solving generally? If students learn how to think about math
    clearly, they will be able to understand math on a deeper level and have their lives more fully transformed by math.
