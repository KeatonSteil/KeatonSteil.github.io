<h4>Anthropocentrism and parochialism</h4>

An anthropocentric theory is a theory which primary explanation is centered on human activity. A parochial error is an error made due to one's point of view. Many false theories in history have suffered due to both anthropocentrism and parochial errors.

For example, most people in history believed that weather was controlled by gods, and that humans could indirectly effect the weather by pleasing the gods. This counts as anthropocentrism for two reasons: humans can control the weather by pleasing gods, and gods can control the weather directly. When we make the theory that gods can control the weather, it is still anthropocentric because the gods employ human-like thought and action. The idea that these cosmically significant beings cared about what humans did placed cosmic significance on us as well.

We now explain the weather in very impersonal ways, and our theories have gotten much better due to this change. Most anthropocentric theories are also parochial errors, but not all parochial errors are anthropocentric. The idea that the sun revolves around the Earth is a parochial error, but it does not involve explaining the movement of the sun in terms of humans. But the theory that the Earth is the center of the universe is another kind anthropocentric theory; it is geomentrically anthropocentric.

The theories that humans are both comsically significant and at the geometrical center of the universe made each other more plausible, and resulted in thinking that was much more anthropocentric than we can even imagine nowadays.

The enlightenment and the rise of scientific thinking has been a primary cause in the change away from anthropocentric thinking, and this has been admirable. In scientifically minded circles, anthropocentric ideas have been so thoroughly criticized that _anti_-anthropocentrism has become a very popular idea.

Anti-anthropocentrism primarily takes the form of two different ideas. The first is commonly refered to as the 'Priciple of Mediocrity' and emphasizes how typical the Earth and her inhabitants are. It states that there is nothing significant about humans (in the cosmic scheme of things). The condition 'in the cosmic scheme of things' is required because humans do seem to have significance according to moral values they apply to themselves. But the 'Priciple of Mediocrity' states that all moral values are inherently anthropocentric and only explain the behavior of humans, which are insignificant. The 'Priciple of Medicrity' is summed up by Stephen Hawking: humans are "just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical plant that's in orbit round a typical star on the outskirts of a typical galaxy."
