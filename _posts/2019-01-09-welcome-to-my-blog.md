Welcome to my blog. I like to learn, and I want to get better at both reading and writing. I will be using this blog as a platform to post my thoughts and to deepen my understanding of the things I read.

_I've always found teaching to be the best way to learn._

Each post will include a summary of a chapter or a section of book I'm reading as well as my thoughts about what I read. I will try and keep my blog posts brief and numerous so that I can get through more reading and writing and thinking and focus less on editing and getting bogged down in the details of my blog. This blog is intended to be a personal tool to help me educate myself.

I may also post my general thoughts without an accompanying book summary. Life updates and other posts may make it onto this blog since I don't use Facebook. So if you are a friend or family and you're wondering about my life, this may be a good place to check.

So if you happen to be reading this, you might find the blog interesting. But if you think it is boring or lame, that's fine too.

Wish me luck.
