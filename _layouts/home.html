        <p>
        Hi! My name is Keaton Steil. I'm currently working towards a B.S. in mathematics with a teaching certification in grades 7-12 at Texas Woman's University.
        I'm hoping to become a teacher so I can educate future mathematicians, engineers, and economists.<br/><br/>
        It is my conviction that math can be fun and interesting for all students.
        From learning the math of financial investments to abstract problem solving, every student's life should be transformed by math!
        And since most students have a hard time getting excited about math, it is my responsibility to get them excited, and change the way they think about math.</p>
