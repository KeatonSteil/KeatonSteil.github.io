<h4>What does it mean to say that we have observed a thing?</h4>

The Palomar Sky Survey is a collection of almost 2,000 photographic negatives of the night sky, which were copied on to glass plates and show stars and galaxies as dark shapes on a white background. Scientists used to use these plates to chart the position of galaxies while looking at the plates under microscopes. They would line up the center of a galaxy using a crosshair in the microscope and press a button to catalog the position. They did this for many thousands of galaxies, and it wasn't easy. Sometimes one could not tell what shapes were galaxies or other objects like stars. Sometimes there were defects in the image which were caused by an error while copying the image. So sometimes when the scientists looked through the eyepiece they saw extraordinary galaxies, many thousands of light-years across, and sometimes they saw... just a bunch of dark specs on the glass plate in front of them?

But when they were looking at the galaxies, they saw dark specs too. What was the difference between seeing a mind bogglingly vast cosmic entity and seeing an error in the method of copying?

Consider this:

When the scientists were making their observations, they did not look at the galaxies _directly_. They did not go outside and look in the direction of the galaxy they were trying to observe, even though if they had does this there would be nothing between their eyes and the galaxy but a few grams of air. They used a telescope, a camera, a photographic developement laboratory, another camera (to make copies of the plates), a truck to bring them the copied plates, and a microscope, and they could see the galaxies better with all that equipment in the way. That equipment relied on theoretical knowledge to function. Theories about the accuracy of telescopes and mircroscopes were invoked as reasons to believe in the accuracy of the observations. 

But what about when someone looks at something directly. How direct is the observation. Our theoretical observer is invoking quite a bit of machinery to make his observations as well. His eyes are recieving photons with different wavelenghts, and sending messages, in the form of electric impulses to his brain. His brain is interpreting those impulses through quite a large framework of both conscious and unconscious theories. Theories about the accuracy of one's vision and the likelihood of making a specific observation color our experience. All observation is theory-laden.

<h4>"In all cases, to say that we have genuinely observed any given thing is to say that we have accurately attributed our evidence (ultimately always evidence inside our own brains) to that thing."</h4>

Explanatory theories tell us how to build and use instruments, including both microscopes and eyes, to accurately interpret the world. "Like conjuring tricks in reverse, such instruments fool our senses into seeing what is really there."

"Our minds conclude that a particular thing is real if and only if it figures in our best explanation of something."
