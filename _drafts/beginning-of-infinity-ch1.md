<h4>But first, some notes on the introduction.</h4>

The introduction is fairly short and makes a few points:

* The extremely rapid and stable progress we enjoy today has happened only once in human history.
* This progress began around the time of the scientific revolution (and was an attibute of a wider philosophical movement known as the enlightenment, Chapter 1).
* Progress has happened in a variety of fields including science, technology, politics, morality, art, and all other aspects of human welfare.
* Some have denied that progress can be made or that progess is desirable. "They should have known better."
* All progress has resulted from the human activity of seeking good explanations.
* While progress and explanation seeking are aspects of human life, they are also significant on the most impersonal, cosmic level - they conform to universal laws of nature that are good explanations.
* People are significant.
* Progress does not have to end in some sort of completion or catastrophe. It is unbounded.
* Explaining the unboundedness of progress takes us through every field of science and philosophy.
* While progress does not have a necessary end, it does have a beginning, a beginning of infinity.

_"Whenever there has been progress, there have been influential thinkers who denied that it was genuine, that it was desirable, or even that the concept was meaningful. They should have known better. There is indeed an objective difference between a false explanation and a true one, between chronic failure to solve a problem and solving it, and also between wrong and right, ugly and beautiful, suffering and its alleviation - and thus between stagnation and progress in the fullest sense."_

This is probably one of my favorite quotes I've ever read. I look foward to understanding his arguments for objective truth better. One goal I have is to be able to understand the objectivity of morality better and to be able to argue for it in a convincing way. I think it is too common that people think that morality is arbitrary, subjective, and entirely culturally defined.

My instinct has always been that moral progress is possible, and that implies that morality is progressing in a direction that is meaningful. That is a hard thing to argue for, but my intuition still points me strongly in that direction. I hope to be able to put my intuition into more concrete, comprehensive, and concise arguments.

<h4>Now on to notes about chapter 1: The Reach of Explanations.</h4>

Deutsch put this quote at the start of the chapter:

_"Behind it all is surely an idea so simple, so beautiful, that when we grasp it - in a decade, a century, or a millennium - we will all say to each other, how could it have been otherwise?"_
John Archibald Wheeler, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 480 (1986)

In the history of science, many philosophers believed that scientific knowledge came about from a process known as inductivism. This is the idea that sensory experiences tell us what is true about reality (as opposed to traditional authoratative sources), and we use sensory experience of local events to extrapolate or generalize to unseen events. Although the alleviation of science from traditional authorities was admirable, it sets up a false authority of its own: sensory experience. 

Inductivism implies that the main purpose of science is to predict the content of sensory experience. But most of our scientific knowledge does not take that form. Astrophysicis is not primarily about humans or human experiences. It is about what stars are and how they behave and the universal laws that govern them.

Let's say we watch a magic show and the magician seemingly saws a person in half. Later in the show we see the person unharmed. We can use inductivism to predict that when we see a magic trick in which a person is sawed in half, they will later appear unharmed. But this "theory" does not solve, or even address, the problem of how the trick is done. This view of the magic trick also fails to explain why the prediction only works for magic shows and not in everyday life.

Another problem with early conceptions of science is an over emphasis on testability. Testability is very important in science, but it was not the deciding factor in leading to the rapid scientific progress of the enlightenment.

Despite the common idea that testable ideas arose along side science, testable ideas have been common forever. Every prophet who theorizes that the end of the world is immenent has a testable theory. So does the gambler with the hunch, 'This is my lucky night - I can feel it.' These ideas can be easily tested, and are easily refuted. But still, they are distictly unscientific.

This is an attribute of the ideas themselves. They are designed to be easily variable. Even when falsified, the prophet or the gambler can reinterpret the omens, pick a different date, and make essentially the same prediction. But when a scientific theory is refuted, the scientist will often have to come up with a whole new theory in order to account for the new information. A theory that is scientific cannot be easily adjusted to accomidate contrary evidence. This is also due to the fact that good explanations are hard to create, while bad explanations are easy to create. 

The final problem I see (due to Deutsch's help) with inductivism is that inductivism cannot in principle address the question of how knowledge is created. Inductivism asserts that knowledge can be recieved through sensory experience. But how could knowledge of the white hot nuclear furnaces of stars be recieved through the sensory experiences of cold floating dots in the sky? For most of human history it was directly observed that these dots were ever glowing lights in the celestial sphere. The sphere would rotate around the Earth and you could see it during the day. The lights needed no fuel, as they never went out, and they didn't fall. We now know that there is no celestial sphere (the Earth rotates and creates the illusion of the stars moving around us), the stars do need fuel (mostly hydrogen), the stars do go out (although they exist for so much longer than human lives that we haven't seen any of the close stars go out), and the stars are in free fall (they are fully effected by gravity). But we could not have learned any of these things through direct sensory experience.

This example has a similar character to a magic trick. The audience of a magic trick and people in history who misinterpreted evidence are both decieved for the same reason. Experiences are not self explanitory. Inductivism makes the claim that experiences cannot be false, only our interpretations of them can be. This is true, but only because our experiences don't say anything about reality. Only our interpretations do, and those are very fallible.

<h4>The solution to all three of these problems is the idea known as fallibilism.</h4>

If the goal of science isn't prediction, what is the goal of science? To explain what is really there and how it behaves and why, in reality.

What is the use of testibility in science if it isn't the primary means of distinguishing scientific ideas and unscientific ideas? The main use of testibility is to choose between two or more theories that have already been posed, both of which appear to be good explanations.

How is knowledge created? It is guessed. Conjectured and then criticized. Science sets up a tradition of criticism. A tradition of proving theories false and searching for better theories. Fallibilism embraces the change and progess inherent in the quest for good explanations. Inductivism and many other theories of knowledge assert that they can set ideas against change; true ideas (which inductivists usually claim to have) can be protected against change and do not need improvement. Fallibilists expect their best theories to contain misconceptions in addition to the truth, so they are predisposed to try and change them and improve upon them.

<h4>One final example to consider and some notes about the reach of explanations:</h4>

How do we know the sun will rise tomorrow? The classic inductivist answer is that we have seen the sun rise every morning before, and so we can extrapolate that the sun will _probably_ rise tomorrow based on our experience of it rising in the past. But that is blantantly false. That is not how we know the sun will rise tomorrow. Here is the real reason:

The Earth is rotating on its axis. We know that as observers on the Earth's surface, the daily rotation of the Earth creates the illusion of the sun revolving around the Earth and rising and setting each day. We also know, based on theories of geometry and optics, that we shouldn't expect to see the sun rise on a cloudy morning, even if the sun really is rising, unseen, behind the clouds. We also know that if we were to be orbiting the Earth, we might see the sun rise every 90 minutes, or not at all, and we knew that from theory before anyone had orbited the Earth. We also know that if we lived near Earth's poles we would see the sun rise and set every 6 months.

All of this we know from theory, and has nothing to do with anyone's experiences. Experiences do not give us knowledge about unexperienced things. That kind of knowledge must be created. Experience is _one of the ways_ we choose between theories that have already been guessed.

Experiences have no reach to explain unexperienced things, which is why inductivism must assert that the future will be like the past and that the unseen will be like the seen. But this misses one of the amazing things about science. Science can be used to predict things that no one has every experienced and things that may have never happened in the history of the universe. When the atomic bombs were dropped in the second world war, they produced a nuclear fission explosion. Stars produce nuclear fusion explosions. Before August 6, 1945 no one had ever witnessed a nuclear fission explosion. There may have never been one in the history of the universe. Yet scientists knew what would happen when the bomb was dropped and why and how. The scientists' explanations had the reach to explain unexperienced things.

Our theories about why the sun will rise tomorrow also have reach to unexperienced things. We know how often the sun will rise on Mars, even though we have never experienced it rising on Mars. We know that suns rise on other planets outside our solar system and galaxy. Planets we haven't yet seen with our best telescopes already operate under that theory, as well as many of our other theories, and we know this already without any experiences of these planets.

Experiences are used to choose between multiple viable explanations, not as a source of knowledge. Knowledge is created. It is created through the process of conjecture and refutation. The quest for good explanations has led to the rapid and stable progress we enjoy today. Explanations have reach to unexperienced things. This reach is not a assumed, it is an intrinsic attibute of an explanation.
